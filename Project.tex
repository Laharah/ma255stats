\title{
	Answering Questions With Government Transparency Data\\
	\large An Exploration of private sector jobs
}

\maketitle
    
    

    
If I decided to get a ``real'' job, and stop being an IT contractor,
working in the public sector is an option. I know they get decent
benefits, but there are a lot of factors to weigh. This is an
exploration of government jobs and salaries pulled from Oregon's
government transparancy website.

\hypertarget{some-assumptions-and-caveats}{%
\subsection{Some Assumptions and
Caveats}\label{some-assumptions-and-caveats}}

\begin{enumerate} \item This data is real life and economic in nature, which is to say, messy
	and somewhat unnatural

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    I will be using an $\alpha$ of 0.05â€“this isn't physics. As this is essentially
	economic data, this seems appropriate.
  \item
	  Confidence intervals will be set to 90\% in keeping with our generosity in terms of
	  precision.
\item
	When calculating certain statistics, I will be sampling from the data. This is to
	allow certain statistics to be computed using the tools I have learned. Other times
	this is done to estimate a simpler distribution than the entire population's real
	distribution. Any time this is done, it will be explicitly stated.
  \end{itemize}
\item
	There is a large amount of data, (approximately 27\unit{\mega\byte} of text data). As
	such, I will be making extensive use of R to calculate certain values and statistics.

  \begin{itemize}
	\item
		I will be displaying only partial and/or relevant results in tables.
	\item
		Code for the calculations will be made available at \todo{github link}

  \end{itemize}
\item
  This is for class. I'm trying to show I learned anything, sometimes
  the data makes that hard to do:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
	  There will be times where in order to apply a particular statistical test, I will
	  make the assumption that the data is normally distributed. This may not always be
	  the case. Whenever this assumption is made, I will say so explicitly.
	\item
		When feasible, the first time a statistical test is encountered I will be showing
		how the result of a statistic is calculated. Other statistics will be summarized.
		Again see the code listing to see how a particular calculation was done.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Which Dept. Did That Woman I Met Work
At?}\label{which-dept.-did-that-woman-i-met-work-at}}

I met a woman at a python conference in early 2020. She said she worked
or had worked for the government as an analyst---I can't remember which.
We talked about what we did for a while, and I asked how well her job
payed; she said that she made ``around 65 grand'' per year.

To do this analysis, we're gonna make some assumptions and pretend some
stuff.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  analyst pay in each dept is normally distributed (it probably isn't
  exactly, but a look at some graphs look roughly normal, good enough
  for me)
\item
  Pretend I \textbf{don't} have access to the full population dataset
\end{itemize}

We're gonna pretend that I went to each department and asked 10
analyists what they made. Also I'll pretend that I did this over the
period from 2015-2020 (all samples randomly and indepently chosen).
We'll use that to estimate the distribution for each department.

\subsection{Step 2: See If There's Even A Difference Between The Average
Salaries In Each
Department}\label{step-2-see-if-theres-even-a-difference-between-the-average-salaries-in-each-department}}

To do this, we're going to conduct an anova test. For this test we are
going to assume: 1. Each departments salary distribution is normal (same
as we said above) 2. Each departments standard deviation is the same
(Not something we're really confident about)

The groups for the anova test are going to be the departments. Here are
our hypotheses:

H0: each department pays their analysts the same on average.

HA: each department does \textbf{not} pay their analysts the same on
average.

    \begin{itemize}
\item
  It looks like we may expect OR to \emph{lose} about 2300 jobs next
  year. This is likely because 2023 seems to be an outlier in growth.
  Wheter this will be the case that 2023 will be a regression to the
  mean, or that 2023 will be the start of a new boom in jobs (something
  that will make us increase our growth predictions) is anyone's guess.
\item
  We are 95\% certain that they will add on between 295 and 1731
  additional jobs on average year-over-year. Our predictive precision
  here is not that great.
\item
  our p-value indicates that with our alpha of 0.05, and a p-value of
  0.0336, we can conclude that on average they are indeed growing their
  workforce.
\item
  Growth is growth, but maybe I should hold off on applying for a job
  next year.

    It looks like I'm confident that they'll be looking for custodians and
research analysts at some point. But because 2022 seems to be such an
outlier, my model expects some sort of regression-to-the-mean. So
according to the data and my statistical models, I shouldn't be planning
to get a job next year.

\section{Which Jobs That I Could Do Have The Most Fair

looking at the data, there are many jobs descriptions that are followed
by numbers. I take this to mean that you can be promoted from one level
to another. If I did one of these jobs (one's I'd be willing to do),
it's important to me that I'm working with people that are being paid
fairly---it makes for a less hostile work enviornment. In this case,
I'll settle for the qualifyer that the salaries in that job are normally
distributed.
